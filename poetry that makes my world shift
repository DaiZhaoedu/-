> My copy of Mid-Mmerican Reivew lay on the table for weeks. Literary writing and i don't always mix well. it standselite and all-knows,nose in the air,page after page of introspection based upon Greek myths and sophisticated-yet-obscure references that only a few will recongize-or so it seems.

literary writing ranks right beside coubtry musuic for me. i knows, stange bed-fellow.yet i tire of the dog getting kicked, the wonmen getting pregnnant,the man leaving the woman running off with  the strnger,the truck breaking down. it is a rare countu song that captures my ear.

i would venture to say i feel rarher elitist when listening to country music, and i don't like mysely when i feel that way. and i feel like an uneducated dunce when readingg literary  wirtings, which is another self-pweception j can live more happily without.

and don't get me started on poetry. mostly i ramble through the lines, and the last word is always my own question:'hua?"
